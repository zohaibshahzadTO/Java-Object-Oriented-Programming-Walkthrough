/*
The cliched first example of inheritance, akin to factorial for recursion or that "output a rectangle of asterisks"
for loops. But there is a reason why every cliche became a cliche in the first place. For convenience, all classes
are given here as static nested classes, but they might as well be separate top level classes. An abstract superclass
that defines the common behaviour of each animal. Cannot be used to create objects, but serves as abstract parameter type
for polymorphic methods that works for all animals.
