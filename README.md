# Java Object Oriented Programming Walkthrough

# Why OOP

Suppose that you want to assemble your own PC, you go to a hardware store and pick up a motherboard, a processor, some RAMs, a hard disk, a casing, a power supply, and put them together.  You turn on the power, and the PC runs.  You need not worry whether the CPU is 1-core or 6-core; the motherboard is a 4-layer or 6-layer; the hard disk has 4 plates or 6 plates, 3 inches or 5 inches in diameter; the RAM is made in Japan or Korea, and so on. You simply put the hardware components together and expect the machine to run.  Of course, you have to make sure that you have the correct interfaces, i.e., you pick an IDE hard disk rather than a SCSI hard disk, if your motherboard supports only IDE; you have to select RAMs with the correct speed rating, and so on.  Nevertheless, it is not difficult to set up a machine from hardware components.

Similarly, a car is assembled from parts and components, such as chassis, doors, engine, wheels, brake and transmission. The components are reusable, e.g., a wheel can be used in many cars (of the same specifications).

Hardware, such as computers and cars, are assembled from parts, which are reusable hardware components.

How about software?  Can you "assemble" a software application by picking a routine here, a routine there, and expect the program to run?  The answer is obviously NO!  Unlike hardware, it is very difficult to "assemble" an application from software components.  Since the advent of computer 70 years ago, we have written tons and tons of programs and routines.  However, for each new application, we have to re-invent the wheels and write the program from scratch!

Why re-invent the wheels? Why re-writing codes? Can you write better codes than those codes written by the experts?


# Traditional Procedural-Oriented Languages

Traditional procedural-oriented programming languages (such as C, Fortran, Cobol and Pascal) suffer some notable drawbacks in creating reusable software components:

The procedural-oriented programs are made up of functions. Functions are less reusable. It is very difficult to copy a function from one program and reuse in another program because the function is likely to reference the global variables and other functions. In other words, functions are not well-encapsulated as a self-contained reusable unit.
The procedural languages are not suitable of high-level abstraction for solving real life problems. For example, C programs uses constructs such as if-else, for-loop, array, method, pointer, which are low-level and hard to abstract real problems such as a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system or a computer soccer game.
The traditional procedural-languages separate the data structures (variables) and algorithms (functions).

# Object-Oriented Programming languages

Object-oriented programming (OOP) languages are designed to overcome these problems.

The basic unit of OOP is a class, which encapsulates both the static properties and dynamic operations within a "box", and specifies the public interface for using these boxes. Since classes are well-encapsulated, it is easier to reuse these classes. In other words, OOP combines the data structures and algorithms of a software entity inside the same box.
OOP languages permit higher level of abstraction for solving real-life problems. The traditional procedural language (such as C and Pascal) forces you to think in terms of the structure of the computer (e.g. memory bits and bytes, array, decision, loop) rather than thinking in terms of the problem you are trying to solve. The OOP languages (such as Java, C++ and C#) let you think in the problem space, and use software objects to represent and abstract entities of the problem space to solve the problem.

For example, suppose you wish to write a computer soccer games (which I consider as a complex application). It is quite difficult to model the game in procedural-oriented languages. But using OOP languages, you can easily model the program accordingly to the "real things" appear in the soccer games.

<li>Player: attributes include name, number, location in the field, and etc; operations include run, jump, kick-the-ball, and etc.</li>
<li>Ball:</li>
<li>Reference:</li>
<li>Field:</li>
<li>Audience:</li>
<li>Weather:</li>

Most importantly, some of these classes (such as Ball and Audience) can be reused in another application, e.g., computer basketball game, with little or no modification.

# Benefits of OOP

The procedural-oriented languages focus on procedures, with function as the basic unit. You need to first figure out all the functions and then think about how to represent data.

The object-oriented languages focus on components that the user perceives, with objects as the basic unit. You figure out all the objects by putting all the data and operations that describe the user's interaction with the data.

Object-Oriented technology has many benefits:

<li>Ease in software design as you could think in the problem space rather than the machine's bits and bytes. You are dealing with high-level concepts and abstractions. Ease in design leads to more productive software development.</li>

<li>Ease in software maintenance: object-oriented software are easier to understand, therefore easier to test, debug, and maintain.</li>

<li>Reusable software: you don't need to keep re-inventing the wheels and re-write the same functions for different situations. The fastest and safest way of developing a new application is to reuse existing codes - fully tested and proven codes.</li>

# OOP Concepts

# What Is an Object?

Objects are key to understanding object-oriented technology. Look around right now and you'll find many examples of real-world objects: your dog, your desk, your television set, your bicycle.

Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior. Dogs have state (name, color, breed, hungry) and behavior (barking, fetching, wagging tail). Bicycles also have state (current gear, current pedal cadence, current speed) and behavior (changing gear, changing pedal cadence, applying brakes). Identifying the state and behavior for real-world objects is a great way to begin thinking in terms of object-oriented programming.

Take a minute right now to observe the real-world objects that are in your immediate area. For each object that you see, ask yourself two questions: "What possible states can this object be in?" and "What possible behavior can this object perform?". Make sure to write down your observations. As you do, you'll notice that real-world objects vary in complexity; your desktop lamp may have only two possible states (on and off) and two possible behaviors (turn on, turn off), but your desktop radio might have additional states (on, off, current volume, current station) and behavior (turn on, turn off, increase volume, decrease volume, seek, scan, and tune). You may also notice that some objects, in turn, will also contain other objects. These real-world observations all translate into the world of object-oriented programming.

Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: they too consist of state and related behavior. An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages). Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication. Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation â€” a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.

Consider a bicycle, for example:

By attributing state (current speed, current pedal cadence, and current gear) and providing methods for changing that state, the object remains in control of how the outside world is allowed to use it. For example, if the bicycle only has 6 gears, a method to change gears could reject any value that is less than 1 or greater than 6.

Bundling code into individual software objects provides a number of benefits, including:

<b>Modularity:</b> The source code for an object can be written and maintained independently of the source code for other objects. Once created, an object can be easily passed around inside the system.
Information-hiding: By interacting only with an object's methods, the details of its internal implementation remain hidden from the outside world.

<b>Code re-use:</b> If an object already exists (perhaps written by another software developer), you can use that object in your program. This allows specialists to implement/test/debug complex, task-specific objects, which you can then trust to run in your own code.

<b>Pluggability and debugging ease:</b> If a particular object turns out to be problematic, you can simply remove it from your application and plug in a different object as its replacement. This is analogous to fixing mechanical problems in the real world. If a bolt breaks, you replace it, not the entire machine.
